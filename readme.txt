This project is designed to explore the SQL Programming Language and the use of Java and the 
JDBC interface and function libraries to access relational databases. In this case, I used the 
Oracle DBMS. The current program is designed to connect to a database stored on GMU's servers.  The sql commands to create a sample database have been included in the src folder.


Specifications:

The program should first prompt the manager for his/her ID or SSN, and then check if the 
employee is really a manager. If not, prompt the user and he/she is not a manager, and stop. 
 
If the user is indeed a manager, then present a screen that will allow the manager to provide the 
employee Ssn, last name, first name, and the other attributes associated with the employee. 
 
Next provide a screen that allows the manager to assign the new employee to one or more 
projects. The total time allocated to all projects should not exceed 40 hours per week. You may 
check this at runtime and provide feedback to the manager so as to allocate the hours to projects 
while satisfying the 40 hours total. 
 
If the new employee has dependents, (yes or no checkbox) then enter the new dependents 
according to the DEPENDENT table attributes. Please write code to handle both cases. 
 
When the data entry is completed, print a report that can be presented to the new employee.
